<EULA.Header>Selling Your Content Through an Epic Marketplace</>

<EULA.Header>1.	HOW EPIC OPERATES ITS MARKETPLACES</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	Epic’s Role in the Marketplaces</>. Epic and its affiliates or subsidiaries (“<EULA.Highlight>Marketplace Operators</>”) operate the Marketplaces through which you may sell and distribute your Content to Customers. The Marketplace Operators are not obligated to host your listing(s) for, or to market or advertise, your Content, and once you have listed your Content, the Marketplace Operators have no obligation to continue to host the Content’s display pages on the Marketplace. Once your Content is made available in the Marketplace, Epic may remove or suspend listing(s) of your Content, but only after we take reasonable steps to provide you with written notice.

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Your Role in the Marketplaces</>. By submitting Content to be listed in a Marketplace, you appoint Epic, and through Epic the Marketplace Operators and third parties we designate, as your undisclosed agents for the sole purposes of marketing the Content, offering the Content for sale, processing payments for the Content, distributing Content through the Marketplaces, and developing systems to protect against prohibited content or activity. When a Customer acquires the Content from a Marketplace, you grant the Customer a license to use the Content and will receive a share of the revenue from the sale, as explained further in Section 5.

<EULA.Highlight>c.	Why Customers use the Marketplaces</>. Customers acquire digital content through the Marketplaces so that they can use the digital content in their own projects. Customers may use digital content they acquire through a Marketplace in many ways. The license you grant to Customers will allow them to use and substantially alter the Content they acquire, including by combining it with other works, and use the Content in a wide variety of projects, in any media, streamed or not streamed, and on platforms run by the Marketplace Operators or third parties.

<EULA.Highlight>d.	Marketplace Pricing</>. When you sell Content via the Marketplace, that transaction is between you and the Customer. For each item of Content you make available through the Marketplace, you will indicate which License Tiers you will offer and a retail price (the “<EULA.Highlight>Listing Price</>”) for each License Tier you indicate. You have complete discretion in setting any Listing Price that complies with the terms of this Agreement. You instruct the Marketplace Operators to market and offer your Content for sale at the Listing Price, adjusted to include any Sales Taxes in accordance with Section 1(e). Additionally, you may opt-in to instruct the Marketplace Operators to apply certain discounts (e.g., Marketplace-wide sales) to the Listing Price from time to time. You may set the Listing Price for Content at $0.00 or a value equal to or greater than $0.99.

<EULA.Highlight>e.	Sales Taxes</>. You authorize Epic to act in its own name but on your behalf for Sales Tax purposes in connection with your sale of Content on a Marketplace. Epic collects Sales Tax from Customers and remits that Sales Tax to the relevant taxing authority for sales of Content that happen in the jurisdictions listed on our “<EULA.Highlight>Tax Jurisdictions List</>” accessible at <a style= "color: deepskyblue" href="https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/o/store/policies">https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/o/store/policies</a>. The Tax Jurisdictions List is subject to change. If you or Epic are liable for Sales Tax in jurisdictions that are not in the Tax Jurisdictions List, we may deduct those taxes from future transfers to you or collect those taxes directly from you. Certain territories may not allow us to remit taxes on your behalf. You are obligated to remit taxes in these jurisdictions to the appropriate tax authority.

<EULA.Highlight>f.	Payment Processing</>. Acting as your agents, Epic or a Marketplace Operator may (i) act as your payment processor for Marketplace transactions for your Content; (ii) accept or decline to accept any form of payment from Customers; (iii) pause a Marketplace transaction for investigation; (iv) refuse to process or cancel any Marketplace transaction (for example, due to concerns about potential fraud, Customer payment issues, or some other potential breach of this Agreement); (v) have Epic’s (or its authorized payment processing services’) name appear on the Customer’s credit or other card statement; (vi) address and resolve disputes related to Marketplace transactions between you and Customers; and (vii) provide, or require you provide, refunds to Customers according to Marketplace refund policies.

<EULA.Highlight>g.	What is Being Sold</>. When we say in this Agreement that Content is offered “for sale” or that Content is “purchased” or “acquired” we mean that Digital Rights (as defined below) in the Content are being offered for sale to or for purchase by Customers. Your ownership of the Content is not being offered for sale or sold.

<EULA.Header>2.	CONTENT LICENSE GRANT</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	Your Content is Yours</>. As between you and Epic, you own all rights in your Content (other than materials you have included in your Content that are licensed to you by Epic and its affiliates). The rights you grant to Epic and Customers herein is not an ownership right, but a license to the Content you own (“<EULA.Highlight>Digital Rights</>”).

<EULA.Highlight>b.	License for Epic to Operate the Marketplaces</>. The Marketplace Operators need your permission in the form of a license to make your Content available in the Marketplace. You grant the Marketplace Operators a license to the Content that allows the Marketplace Operators to: 

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Copy the Content</> (e.g., to copy content to Marketplace servers and facilitate Customers’ transactions and downloads);

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Display the Content</> (e.g., to show your Content and Submission Materials on Marketplace websites and promote the Content through social media);

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Distribute the Content </>(e.g., to provide access to your Content to Customers who have acquired Digital Rights);

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Perform the Content </>(e.g., to demonstrate your Content to the public, including at live events such as trade shows);

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Use the Content </>(e.g., to develop systems to protect against prohibited content or activity and otherwise improve the Marketplace).  

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Restriction on Epic’s License</>. The Marketplace Operators may exercise the license granted in Section 2(b) for the sole purpose of allowing the Marketplace Operators to promote and market Content, to distribute Content to Customers, and to operate, protect and support the Marketplaces. Marketplace Operators may also exercise the license granted in Section 2(b) to promote and market the Marketplace. In addition to the foregoing, the license you grant Epic is subject to the following restrictions: 

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Limited Territory</>: The Marketplace Operators will only offer Content for sale on your behalf to Customers who indicate they are located within the Territory.

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Duration</>: The Marketplace Operators’ license will continue until your Withdrawal Request for Content is processed; after that, the license still continues, but only so Customers who have already acquired the Content can re-download the Content.

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Sublicensable</>: The Marketplace Operators can sublicense (through multiple tiers) portions of this license only as necessary to exercise its rights in this Agreement (like to payment service providers).  

     -	<EULA.Highlight>No Other Payments</>: The Marketplace Operators pay you amounts described in Section 5, but we do not owe you any other payments under this agreement. 

     -	<EULA.Highlight>Limited Purpose</>: The Marketplace Operators can only exercise the Content license rights you grant us to: a) promote, market, and provide access to the Content to Customers; b) promote, market, and provide access to a Marketplace; and c) to operate, promote, market, and support a Marketplace.

<EULA.Highlight>ii.	Responsibility of Marketplace Operators</>. Epic will be responsible for the Marketplace Operators’ compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

<EULA.Highlight>c.	Your License to Customers</>. You will grant Customers who acquire Content from a Marketplace a license to use that Content (the “<EULA.Highlight>Customer License</>”). You instruct the Marketplace Operators to inform Customers of any Customer Licenses that you have granted them.

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Standard Marketplace License</>. Unless you and Epic agree otherwise, you will grant the Customer License using the Marketplace Operator’s then-current <a style= "color: deepskyblue" href="https://www.fab.com/eula">Fab End User License Agreement</a> (“<EULA.Highlight>Standard License</>”). Under the Standard License, you will grant the Customer an irrevocable, royalty-free, sublicensable (through multiple tiers), fully paid-up, worldwide license to use, reproduce, distribute, display and perform (whether publicly or otherwise), prepare derivative works of and otherwise modify, use and exploit all or any portion of such Content, in any form or media (now known or later developed). You can view the Marketplace Operator’s current Standard License from your Marketplace portal. 

<EULA.Highlight>ii.	Alternative License</>. For any Content that you and Epic agree will be offered on your behalf under an open-source license, you will grant the Customer License using the agreed upon open-source license. Only Content for which you have set the Listing Price at $0.00 may be so licensed to Customers under an open-source license. If you and Epic agree to offer Content under an open-source license that you previously were offering under a Standard License, you will grant Customers who previously acquired your Content the option to use Content under the new open-source license, their prior Standard License, or both.

<EULA.Highlight>iii.	License Tiers and Customer License changes</>. If you change which Customer License types or License Tiers may be acquired for your Content, licenses you have already granted (including licenses granted under Customer Licenses or License Tiers you have decided to no longer offer) will not be affected.

<EULA.Highlight>iv.	License Compliance</>. Customers are solely responsible for their compliance with the terms of the Customer License. Epic does not monitor how Customers use Content, including how Customers may use Content on Epic services. If you believe your Content is being infringed or misused on any Epic service, please report the suspected abuse <a style= "color: deepskyblue" href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/infringement" >here</a>.

<EULA.Highlight>d.	License for Epic to Host Reference Assets</>. The Customer License you grant may allow Customers to access Content by means of a “reference asset” and to grant others permission to do the same in certain circumstances. Reference assets are files that, rather than containing a full copy of the Content, contain information about where a copy of the Content can be accessed online. In order for reference assets to function, there must be a copy of your content hosted online for the reference asset to point to. For this reason, when you grant a Customer License that permits Customers to access Content by means of a reference asset, you instruct Epic to host copies of the Content online on your behalf for that purpose. In case such Content is updated by you, you agree that Epic may host copies of a previous version of the Content and allow Customers to access it in case the updated version of the Content is deemed not viable for use (for instance, when the updated Content does not work properly). For more information about how reference assets work, see <a style= "color: deepskyblue" href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/uefn/Verse/modules-and-paths-in-verse">https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/creative/docs/uefn/Verse/modules-and-paths-in-verse</a>.

<EULA.Highlight>e.	Waiver of Moral Rights</>. As described in Section 1©, a primary reason Customers acquire Content on a Marketplace is so they have freedom to incorporate Content into their projects without further restriction after acquiring said Content. Accordingly, you waive, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all rights of paternity, integrity, attribution, disclosure, withdrawal, and any other rights that may be known as “moral rights” (“<EULA.Highlight>Moral Rights</>”) with respect to the use of Content and Feedback (as defined in Section 18(d)) pursuant to this Agreement. To the extent this waiver is not permitted by applicable law, you will not enforce such Moral Rights against Epic, Marketplace Operators, or Customers or their respective permitted successors, licensees, and assigns. 

<EULA.Header>3.	SUBMISSION AND CONTENT REQUIREMENTS</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	All Necessary Rights</>. You will not provide any Submission Materials or Content to Epic or a Marketplace Operator for which you do not have all necessary intellectual property, publicity, and other proprietary or third-party rights to grant all of the licenses described in this Agreement.

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Update Parity</>. If your Content is made available to end users through channels other than the Marketplaces, you will provide any Updates to Epic no later than you provide them to any other third party.

<EULA.Highlight>c.	Non-Compatible Licenses</>. Unless you and Epic agree otherwise, you will not provide any Submission Materials or Content to Epic that contains any code or other materials that are covered by a license that would directly or indirectly require that all or part of the Submission Materials or Content be governed under any terms other than those of this Agreement. This means, for example, that Submission Materials and Content may not include code or materials licensed under any of the following licenses: GNU General Public License (GPL), GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL), Lesser GPL (LGPL) (unless you are merely dynamically linking a shared library), or Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License.

<EULA.Highlight>j.	Union Guild</>. Each time you upload Content, you represent and warrant that: (i) the Content was not produced under the jurisdiction of any collective bargaining agreement; (ii) the Content is not subject to any union or guild restrictions or obligations; and (iii) no third party fees to, or permissions from, any guild, union or collective bargaining association, or any performer member thereof, will be required for the exploitation of the rights contemplated hereunder (including any rights you grant to a Customer). You expressly acknowledge that the Marketplace Operators are not signatories to any collective bargaining agreement with any guild or union which may claim jurisdiction over the services Marketplace Operators render pursuant to this Agreement, and no activities to be performed in connection with this Agreement or use of Content will cause Marketplace Operators or a Customer to become subject to the jurisdiction of any union or guild. 

<EULA.Header>4.	YOUR AND EPIC’S RESPONSIBILITIES</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	Your Responsibilities</>. As between you and Epic, you are solely responsible for:

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Content Creation</>: creating Content by (i) using your own equipment, materials, supplies and other resources at your own expense and (ii) exercising your own talent, skills, judgment and aesthetic sense;

<EULA.Highlight>ii.	Content QA</>: performing industry standard quality assurance testing for the Content;

<EULA.Highlight>iii.	Bug Fixes and Ongoing Compliance</>: providing Updates to Epic as needed to resolve bugs, ensure compliance with Marketplace requirements, or otherwise support and maintain your Content for as long as you make it available on the Marketplace, including when reasonably requested to do so by Epic and/or where necessary to cure a violation of this Agreement; and

<EULA.Highlight>iv.	Content Customer Support</>: providing Customers with support and maintenance for Content they have acquired.

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Epic Responsibilities</>. As between you and Epic, Epic is solely responsible for

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Marketplace Support</>: Providing customer support and maintenance for the Marketplaces.

<EULA.Header>5.	REVENUE SHARE</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	Revenue Share</>. When a Customer buys Digital Rights as described in Section 1 above, the Marketplace Operators collect their money and deduct any Sales Tax that they will remit to tax authorities, as required by law. The Marketplace Operators pay you 88% of the amount charged for a sale of Digital Rights, in each case after deducting applicable Sales Tax and amounts attributable to payment processing fees, discounts, and charges related to fraud; chargebacks and Customer refunds will also be deducted from the payout (“<EULA.Highlight>Seller Proceeds</>”).” 

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Revenue Report</>. Epic will generate a Revenue Report for you no later than sixty (60) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter. The Revenue Report shall be binding and conclusive upon you with respect to the Seller Proceeds payable or creditable to you thereunder unless challenged by you within twelve (12) months following receipt of the Revenue Report. 

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Updated Reports</>. If the inputs used to calculate Seller Proceeds for a period change from what was initially reflected in a Revenue Report (e.g. because a Customer was issued a refund), Epic may issue an updated Revenue Report for up to twelve (12) months from when the original Revenue Report was provided.

<EULA.Highlight>ii.	Challenging a Report</>. To challenge a Revenue Report, you must deliver to Epic a written notice that informs Epic you are challenging a Revenue Report and details the nature of your objections. No action, suit, or proceeding of any nature in respect of any Revenue Report or other accounting rendered by Epic under this Agreement may be maintained against Epic unless such action, suit or other proceeding is commenced within twelve (12) months after the date of Epic’s response to your challenge to a Revenue Report.

<EULA.Highlight>c.	Payment Details</>. Here’s what to expect for receiving transfers of your Seller Proceeds from Epic:

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Merchant Account</>: In order for Epic to transfer your amounts due under this Agreement, you must have a merchant account in good standing with a provider currently designated by Epic as being Marketplace-compatible (your “<EULA.Highlight>Merchant Account</>”). Epic does not administer Merchant Accounts and is not a party to any agreement you have with your Merchant Account provider. 

<EULA.Highlight>ii.	Monthly Transfers</>: Subject to your ongoing compliance with Section 8(b), no later than 45 days from the end of each month Epic will initiate an electronic funds transfer to the Merchant Account whose details you have provided through your Marketplace portal. The amount transferred to you will be Epic’s then current calculation of the Seller Proceeds owed to you and other amounts you owed to Epic under this Agreement. All transfers to you will be payable in United States dollars. While there will be a delay between when a Customer makes a purchase and when the Seller Proceeds are credited to you, it will be no longer than 60 days from the end of the month in which a transaction occurred.

<EULA.Highlight>iii.	Payout Minimum:</> Generally, we will only initiate transfers for amounts over $100. If you haven’t accrued $100 in unpaid Seller Proceeds, we will roll your unpaid Seller Proceeds over monthly and initiate a transfer to you only when the amount crosses the $100 payment threshold. We will, however, initiate a transfer for any Seller Proceeds that was earned more than a year ago, regardless of the amount.

<EULA.Highlight>iv.	Bank Fees</>: If we incur any wire transfer, bank, or payment fees when making a transfer to your Merchant Account, we may deduct those fees from your Seller Proceeds. We have no responsibility for any of these types of fees incurred by you.

<EULA.Highlight>d.	Taxes</>. Other than the Sales Tax described in Section 1(e), you are responsible for all other taxes, including income taxes, levies, VAT, and similar fees due on any transfer we make to you under this Agreement. In certain jurisdictions, tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report tax information about you, withhold taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine is sufficient to fulfill our obligation to withhold taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until you provide us with sufficient documentation. If we withhold taxes on amounts due to you under this Agreement, we will remit those taxes to the proper tax authorities. We will give you a receipt for any of these withholding taxes and we’ll also provide you other documents you reasonably request so that you can claim foreign tax credits or refunds.

<EULA.Highlight>e.	Tax Forms</>. You must provide Epic a completed Form W-9 (if you are based in the United States) or Form W-8BEN (if you are not based in the United States) and other tax information that may be requested by Epic, and you must update Epic if any of your tax information changes. If you do not, Epic may not transfer any Seller Proceeds to you until you have provided full and complete information.

<EULA.Highlight>f.	Negative Balances</>. If the amounts paid to you under this Agreement exceed the Seller Proceeds owed to you under this Agreement Epic may, at its choice, either (i) offset any overpayment against future Seller Proceeds otherwise due to you or (ii) require you to repay the overpayment to Epic. If Epic elects to require repayment, the parties shall negotiate in good faith with respect to a reasonable payment plan for such repayment.

<EULA.Header>6.	USE OF BRAND FEATURES AND SUBMISSION MATERIALS</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	Brand Features</>. You and Epic each own or license trademarks, logos, and other Brand Features. As between you and Epic, you own your Brand Features and we own our Brand Features. No licenses are granted to either party’s Brand Features except as expressly stated in this Agreement.

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Your Brand Features</>. As stated in Section 2(b), you grant the Marketplace Operators a limited license to make certain uses of your Submission Materials and Content. Any Brand Features, such as your name and logo, that are included in your Submission Materials or Content are included in that license. See Section 2(b) for how this license to the Marketplace Operators is restricted.

<EULA.Highlight>c.	Epic’s Brand Features.</> Nothing in this Agreement gives you a right to use any of Epic’s Brand Features.

<EULA.Header>Our Relationship</>

<EULA.Header>7.	THIS AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND EPIC</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	Amendments</>. This Agreement can only be amended: (i) in a writing signed by both you and Epic or (ii) by you agreeing to an updated version of this Agreement that is presented to you through a Marketplace. 

If we make changes to this Agreement, you are not required to accept the amended version. Until you do accept the amended version, this Agreement will continue to apply. If we make changes to this Agreement, you may not be permitted to log in to your Epic account, access the Marketplace, or upload additional Content until you have accepted the amended Agreement.

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Exhibits</>. You and Epic may, from time to time, execute exhibits with special terms related to certain Content (each, an “<EULA.Highlight>Exhibit</>”). An Exhibit will only be effective upon being signed by both parties. To the extent there is a conflict between an Exhibit and the body of this Agreement, the Exhibit will control to the extent of the conflict only with regard to the Content identified in the Exhibit. An Exhibit will not affect the terms applicable to Content not described in the Exhibit, and following the termination or expiration of an Exhibit, Content identified in the Exhibit will be subject to the standard terms of this Agreement. Following termination or expiration of an Exhibit, you may submit a Withdrawal Request for any Content you do not wish to remain in the Marketplaces under the standard terms. (See Section 10 for more information about Withdrawal Requests.)

<EULA.Highlight>c.	Notice</>. Where this Agreement calls for notice from us, including written notice, we may provide notice to you through the Epic services or by any email address that you’ve provided to us. Where this Agreement calls for notice to us, including written notice, you may provide notice to us by emailing <a style= "color: deepskyblue" href="mailto:legal@epicgames.com">legal@epicgames.com</a>. Notices, when provided to you through the Epic services, will be effective when you access the Epic services, and when sent by email, will be effective when the email is sent.

When you accept this Agreement on behalf of another person or entity, (i) all references to “you” throughout this Agreement will include, and this Agreement will be binding on, that person or entity, and (ii) in the event you violate this Agreement, that person or entity agrees to be responsible to us.

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Eligibility</>. You must be of the age of legal majority where you live to enter into this Agreement. You must not be or be acting on behalf of any person or entity that is (i) on the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List or other similar lists maintained by any U.S. government entity pursuant to economic sanctions laws or (ii) located in, organized in, or ordinarily resident in any country or territory that is subject to a U.S. embargo.

<EULA.Header>9.	Privacy</>

Your privacy is important to Epic. Please review our Privacy Policy (<a style= "color: deepskyblue" href="https://www.epicgames.com/privacypolicy">epicgames.com/privacypolicy</a>). It describes how Epic may collect, use, and share information when you use a Marketplace. You can also learn more about how we enable access to data <a style= "color: deepskyblue" href="https://www.fab.com/legal">here</a>. 

<EULA.Header>10.	WITHDRAWING YOUR CONTENT</>

<EULA.Highlight>a.	Withdrawal Requests</>. You can, at any time, request for any piece of Content to no longer be offered for sale on your behalf through the Marketplaces (each request, a “<EULA.Highlight>Withdrawal Request</>”). Withdrawal Requests must be submitted through your Marketplace account. 

<EULA.Highlight>b.	Effects of Withdrawing Content</>. Within a commercially reasonable time after you submit a Withdrawal Request, Marketplace Operators will stop offering for sale the Content you have withdrawn on the Marketplaces.

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Customers May Still Access Acquired Content</>. After Content is withdrawn, Marketplace Operators may exercise the license granted in Section 2(b) for the sole purpose of allowing Customers who have already acquired the Content to re-download the Content.

<EULA.Highlight>ii.	Customers’ Continued Use of Content</>. Customer Licenses granted pursuant to Section 2© will be unaffected by Content being withdrawn. This means, for example, that Customers will have no obligation to delete previously acquired Content and may continue to freely use that Content after it is no longer offered for sale in the Marketplaces.

<EULA.Header>11.	TERMINATION OF MARKETPLACE ACCOUNT</>

You may terminate your Marketplace account at any time. Epic may terminate your Marketplace account if Epic reasonably believes you have violated the terms of this Agreement or other Agreements you have with Epic. The termination of your Marketplace account, or your Epic account, by either you or Epic, will be treated as a Withdrawal Request for all Content for sale through the Marketplace. See Section 10 for the effects of a Withdrawal Request.

<EULA.Header>12.	CONFIDENTIALITY</>

Any Confidential Information received or otherwise learned by a party (as “<EULA.Highlight>Recipient</>”) from the other party (as “<EULA.Highlight>Discloser</>”) will be treated by the Recipient as confidential and proprietary information of the Discloser and will be used by Recipient solely in connection with its performance of this Agreement. The Recipient will not disclose the Discloser’s Confidential Information, except to affiliates, employees, or anyone acting on its behalf who need to know it in connection with the performance of this Agreement and who have agreed in writing to keep it confidential. The Recipient will ensure that such persons and entities use the Confidential Information only to exercise rights and fulfill obligations under this Agreement and that they keep it confidential. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information when legally compelled by a court or other government or tax authority. To the extent permitted by law, the Recipient will promptly provide the Discloser with sufficient notice of all available details of the legal requirement and reasonably cooperate with the Discloser’s efforts to challenge the disclosure, seek an appropriate protective order, or pursue such other legal action, as the Discloser may deem appropriate.

<EULA.Highlight>k.	Artificial Intelligence. </>

<EULA.Highlight>i.	Identifying Content that Should Not be Used With Generative AI Programs.</> You are able to tag Content with “NoAI” if you would like the Content to be prohibited from use (a) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs, (b) in the development of Generative AI Programs, or (c) as inputs to Generative AI Programs. Except for Content that requires the NoAI tag under separate terms of use provided by Epic or its affiliates, this tag will not be applied to your Content by default and you must actively designate your Content for the “NoAI” tag to apply. While Content remains tagged, labeled, or otherwise marked “NoAI” via the functionality provided by the platform, it will be known as “<EULA.Highlight>NoAI Content</>.”

For purposes of this Agreement, “<EULA.Highlight>Generative AI Programs</>” means artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural networks, or similar technologies designed to automate the generation of or aid in the creation of new content, including but not limited to audio, visual, or text-based content. The Standard License you grant to Customers who acquire NoAI Content prohibits the Customer from using the NoAI Content (a) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs; (b) in the development of Generative AI Programs; or (c) as inputs to Generative AI Programs.

Epic uses artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies in our Safety and Discovery Tools to make sure the Content, the services we provide on Fab.com or via any official Fab plugin and Epic's other products and services comply with terms of our services, our Epic Games Content Guidelines and Community Rules and to improve our search and recommendations. We use your Content to improve how our Safety and Discovery Tools operate. These tools perform a wide range of safety workloads, like identifying dangerous and illegal content, fraud, spam, unauthorized automation, fake accounts, and content, users or interactions which might break our rules. In addition to safety, we may further classify your Content to provide services like search, recommendations and content discovery. Subject to the above, Epic does not use publishers' Content and does not license it to third parties for use in datasets for, training of, or as inputs to Generative AI Programs and agrees, whether or not Content is NoAI Content, not to exercise the license granted in Section 2(b) to use any of your Content or to license any of your Content to third parties for use (a) in datasets utilized by Generative AI Programs, (b) in the development of Generative AI Programs, or (c) as inputs to Generative AI Programs.

<EULA.Highlight>ii.	Identifying Content Created With Generative AI Programs</>. When your Content is created using Generative AI Programs, you are required to tag the Content as “CreatedWithAI” via the functionality provided by the Marketplace. 

Under this Agreement, Content is considered to be created using Generative AI Programs where a material portion of the Content is generated with Generative AI Programs, whether characters, backgrounds, or other material elements. Content is not considered to be created using Generative AI Programs merely for use of features that solely operate on the Content (e.g., content-aware fill) or that don’t introduce material Generative AI elements into your work (e.g., AI based image upscaling).

<EULA.Highlight>l.	Content ranking.</> To help our users more easily navigate Fab to find products that are interesting and relevant, we sometimes organize products for display to users.
