AFFILIATE AGREEMENT

Term. 
The term of this Agreement will commence on the date that Affiliate accepts this Agreement by clicking “SUBMIT” (the “Effective Date”) and will continue unless and until terminated by Company or Affiliate in accordance with Section II.6. (the “Term”).
Affiliate Content.
Affiliate shall create content, including, without limitation, Game Content (as defined below), in order to promote Video Games through an attributable link or an affiliate tag that Affiliate will receive through the Affiliate Portal (collectively, the “Affiliate Content”). As used herein, the term “Video Games” means, collectively, the video game software known as Fortnite and any other Company or third-party video game software that Company may enable for promotion through the Affiliate Portal in connection with this Agreement.
Affiliate shall clearly and conspicuously disclose his/her/its affiliation with Company in all Affiliate Content in accordance with the T&Cs.
Affiliate Content will be subject to Company’s right and ability to take down such Affiliate Content at any time for any reason. Affiliate will comply and/or assist with any such take down request from Company.
Affiliate Rules, Attribution, and Compensation.

Rules.
Affiliate must (a) have a validated email address, (b) register using Affiliate’s real name, (c) provide a list of affiliated social media channels, (d) have at least one linked social media account to verify Affiliate’s identity, and (e) enable two-factor authorization on Affiliate’s Epic Account.
Affiliate must agree to (a) the Affiliate Portal Code of Conduct (“Code of Conduct), (b) the Fortnite End User License Agreement (“Fortnite EULA”), and (c) the Epic Games Store EULA (“EGS EULA”).
Affiliate must be approved by Epic Games and, if so approved, will receive an email notifying Affiliate of Epic Games’ approval. Once approved, Affiliate may retrieve an Affiliate link or tag from the Affiliate Portal after providing Affiliate’s PayPal or bank account information to Epic Games.
If Affiliate is found in violation of this Agreement, the Code of Conduct, the Fortnite EULA, and/or the EGS EULA (in each case as determined by Epic Games), Affiliate will be banned from further use of the Affiliate Portal and Affiliate acknowledges that he/she/it shall have no right to any current earned funds or any future funds generated by Affiliate’s links or tags in the event of any such ban. 

Attribution.
A user becomes an “Attributed User” when the user clicks an attribution link or enters an affiliate tag using any device that the user has signed into using the user’s Epic Account ID. Affiliate will receive compensation in the form of a commission for purchases and/or redemptions made by an Attributed User in a Video Game or the Epic Games portal if attributed to Affiliate. 
An Attributed User is only from the most recent attribution. A user cannot be attributed to themselves. Once a user has been attributed, they always have a last attribution, which is the attribution link or tag that the user has most recently used. Affiliate will only be compensated for purchases or redemptions made by Attributed Users that specifically are attributed most recently to Affiliate.

Compensation.
Affiliate’s compensation under this Agreement will consist of compensation for commissions on attributed purchases and/or redemptions that total, in the aggregate, more than $100 (the “Compensation Threshold”) during any calendar month (each such period, a “Compensation Period”).
Compensation for attributions that meet the Compensation Threshold occur at least 45 days from the end of the applicable Compensation Period, and, in the case of Affiliate’s first compensation, his/her/its compensation will occur at least 45 days after the end of the first calendar month as an Affiliate.
Affiliate must provide valid PayPal or bank account information. 
To change payment information, Affiliate must contact player support.
An Affiliate’s commission rate for attributed purchases and redemptions will be reflected in the Affiliate Portal. 
Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide advance notice of any rate changes. Any changes will only affect Affiliate links and tags created after the applicable rate change.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Affiliate shall use official terminology in connection with Company’s products or services, in each case as provided by Company.  Affiliate shall promptly remove/delete any Affiliate Content upon Company’s request.  In connection with this Agreement, Affiliate shall comply with all applicable laws and guidance, including, without limitation, the Federal Trade Commission Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonial in Advertising (as they may be updated) (the “FTC Endorsement Guides”).
Affiliate Content.  Affiliate shall ensure that the Affiliate Content will comply with any Company instructions, and also shall ensure that no Affiliate Content will (a) include inappropriate or offensive content (as solely determined by Company in its reasonable discretion); (b) misrepresent the source of anything in the Affiliate Content, including impersonation of another individual or entity; (c) include links to external sites that violate these provisions; or (d) include content that is protected by intellectual property laws, rights of privacy or publicity, or any other applicable law unless Affiliate owns or controls the rights thereto or has received all necessary consents such that the use thereof in accordance with this Agreement by Company, and its licensees, successors, assigns and agents (collectively, the “Permitted Parties”) shall not violate the rights of any third party.

Ownership of the Affiliate Content, excluding Company Materials that may be incorporated therein, shall vest in Affiliate, provided that Affiliate may not use the Affiliate Content except as provided herein or as approved by Company.  
If, and only to the extent that, Affiliate is not a Minor, Affiliate grants the Permitted Parties the royalty-free, worldwide, fully paid-up right and license to use, reproduce, distribute, modify, publicly perform, translate, create derivative works from, publicly display and otherwise exploit the Affiliate Content solely for the purpose of advertising and promoting Video Games in accordance with the terms of this Agreement during the Term.  In addition, without limiting the foregoing, Company shall have the right to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and otherwise commercially exploit the Affiliate Content in connection with the development and exploitation of new features, elements, or game modes for Video Games, as applicable (such content, “Game Content”), or for archival purposes, as applicable.  In all cases, Affiliate shall have no claim to compensation (other than as specified herein) and no claim (including, without limitation, claims based upon invasion of privacy or right of publicity) arising out of any use or blurring of the Affiliate Content. The parties acknowledge that the Affiliate Content and other materials distributed or made available during the Term may be retained by third parties and may be available and accessible, including, without limitation, online through third party websites, platforms, and/or services, whether during or after the Term, and that (i) Company cannot control all of such availability or accessibility, (ii) such availability or accessibility shall not be deemed a breach of this Agreement, (iii) Company will not have any obligation related thereto, and (iv) Company will not be responsible or liable for such availability or accessibility or for the acts or omissions of third parties with respect to such materials.

It is further understood and agreed that Company is not obligated to use in any manner any Affiliate Content or any other materials or services provided under this Agreement.  Except for with respect to any Game Content, Affiliate can withdraw the aforementioned license at any time during the Term and thereafter; provided, however, that this shall not affect the lawfulness of the use Epic Games has made of such license before its withdrawal.

Termination.  
Company may terminate this Agreement with 15 days’ notice for any reason or no reason at all. Either party may terminate this Agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party. If an Event of Force Majeure (as defined below) occurs, in addition to any other rights and remedies that Company may have hereunder or at law or in equity, Company shall have the right to immediately terminate this Agreement.  “Event of Force Majeure” is defined as a natural catastrophe, labor dispute or strike, act of God or public enemy, war, municipal ordinance, state or federal law, governmental order or regulation, or any other similar cause beyond Affiliate’s control that adversely affects Affiliate’s services or the Permitted Parties’ rights to use/create the Affiliate Content.
In the event of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section II.6.a. above, Affiliate shall only be entitled to payments accrued as of the date of such termination (i.e., the pro rata portion of any compensation paid or payable to Affiliate up to and including the date of such termination).  
Confidentiality.  Affiliate will not disclose (including, without limitation, via social media, etc.) any trade secrets or confidential information of Company to any third parties, including, without limitation, any content of any advertising that Company has not yet released to the general public, Affiliate’s relationship with Company (unless and until publicly disclosed by Company), and any of the terms of this Agreement (including, without limitation, the amount of compensation paid hereunder).  
Non-Union.  Given the nature of the services to be performed by Affiliate, the parties do not envision that any of Affiliate’s services hereunder will be performed, or that any of the Affiliate Content will be produced, within the jurisdiction of any union or guild agreement, including, without limitation, the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract (the “SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract”).  However, if it is ever determined that any of Affiliate’s services or the Affiliate Content fall within the jurisdiction of the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract, and provided that no coverage waiver applies under the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract, then: (a) Affiliate will be entitled to minimum scale payments payable pursuant to the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract, which payments shall be credited against the portion of Affiliate’s compensation which is allocated by Company to services covered by the SAG-AFTRA Commercials Contract (with such allocation to be reasonable and consistent with any applicable guidelines) (the “Allocated Portion”), (b) in exchange for an additional payment of $100, Company shall be entitled to unlimited editing rights with respect to the use of the applicable Affiliate Content on the internet and in new media, and (c) Company will cause contributions to be made, on Affiliate’s behalf, to the applicable union’s or guild’s pension, health and welfare plans, with the amount of such contributions to be calculated based on the Allocated Portion.

In addition, Company agrees to defend, indemnify and hold Affiliate harmless from and against any and all third party claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable outside attorneys’ fees) arising out of any Company products or services, except as caused by Affiliate’s negligence or misconduct.  This provision shall survive the expiration or termination of this Agreement. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION HEREOF, IN NO EVENT SHALL COMPANY OR ITS DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES, CONTROLLED AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, OR REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO AFFILIATE, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, EVEN IF COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LIABILITY.
No Insurance.  Affiliate acknowledges that Company does not provide for nor carry any insurance of any kind for Affiliate’s benefit or that of Affiliate’s heirs, executors and administrators relative to Affiliate’s obligations under this Agreement. Affiliate is solely responsible for obtaining and paying for any life, accident, automobile, property or other insurance relative to Affiliate’s services under this Agreement.
Miscellaneous.  Any payments made hereunder shall be subject to any deductions required by law.  The parties are solely independent contractors, and Affiliate shall not be considered an agent or employee of Company.
