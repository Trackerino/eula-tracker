NOTE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO A WAIVER OF CLASS ACTION RIGHTS, AS DETAILED IN SECTION 11.

<EULA.Header>1.        License Grant</>

1.1 Software License. Licensor grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable limited right and license to use the Software for any lawful purpose (the “License”). In addition, if you are using the Educational Version, the Community Edition or the Trial Version, you may not use the Software for any commercial purpose. If you are using the Educational Version, you represent and warrant that you are a student or an instructor of an Academic Institution.

1.2 Twinmotion Content. You may only use Twinmotion Content for the purpose of visualizing content within Twinmotion and exporting images and videos as permitted under this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, you may use and modify Twinmotion Content outside of Twinmotion provided that such use and modification is for the sole purpose of importing that content into Twinmotion for the above purpose.

1.3 Restrictions and Limitations.

The rights that Licensor grants you under the License are subject to the Seat limitations and other terms and restrictions specified in any applicable Software Order and the other terms of this Agreement, including full payment of all amounts due under Section 3 (if any), and you may only make use of the License if you comply with all applicable terms.

The License becomes effective on the date you accept this Agreement. The Software is licensed, not sold, to you under the License. The License does not grant you any title or ownership in the Software.

You may not do any of the following with respect to the Software or any of their parts: (a) copy, reproduce, display, perform, or otherwise use it in a way that is not expressly authorized in this Agreement; (b) sell, rent, lease, license, distribute, or otherwise transfer it; provided, however, that Twinmotion Presenter applications may be transferred to third parties for the sole purpose of sharing and viewing Twinmotion projects; (c) reverse engineer, derive source code from, modify, adapt, translate, decompile, or disassemble it or make derivative works based on it; (d) remove, disable, circumvent, or modify any proprietary notice or label or security technology included in it; (e) use it to infringe or violate the rights of any third party, including but not limited to any intellectual property, publicity, or privacy rights; (f) use, export, or re-export it in violation of any applicable law or regulation; or (g) use it to train or test any artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, neural network or similar technology or for the purpose of building or enhancing any database for such purposes.

<EULA.Header>2.        Seat Limitations</>

You will ensure that anyone who obtains the Software from you, or otherwise uses the same pursuant to the licenses granted to you under this Agreement, complies with the limitations set forth below. Without limiting the foregoing, you will be responsible for each User’s compliance with the terms of this Agreement. You may not have a greater number of Users of the Software than the number of Seats of Software for which you have paid pursuant to the applicable Software Order. You may not have more than one individual use a particular installation at any given time (e.g., may not have multiple Users sharing a single installed copy over a network). Any use or installation of a Seat by you shall be in compliance with the relevant Software Order.

If you are a student or an instructor of an Academic Institution that has received a valid license to use the Educational Version, you may install the Educational Version on any of your computers, and you may allow all users of those computers to use those Educational Versions under the License.

Any Software Order executed by you and Licensor shall be automatically incorporated herein by reference as of the Software Order effective date specified therein. Subject to Section 3 and the paragraph below, in the event of an inconsistency between this Agreement and such Software Order, such Software Order shall prevail with respect to the Seats described therein.

<EULA.Header>3.        License Fees</>

Your License will be subject to payment of applicable License Fees unless your Software Order states otherwise.

Licensor may accept any payment in any amount without prejudice to Licensor’s right to recover the balance of the amount due or to pursue any other right or remedy. No endorsement or statement by you or acceptance by Licensor will be construed as an accord or satisfaction.

You are responsible for all taxes on all payments required to be made to Licensor (other than taxes Licensor are required to make on its income, which is Licensor’s responsibility).

<EULA.Header>The Software are provided on an “as is” and “as available” basis, “with all faults” and without warranty of any kind.

Further, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the aggregate liability of the Licensor Parties arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or the Software will not exceed the greater of (A) the total amounts you have paid (if any) to Licensor for the particular Software to which the liability relates during the twelve (12) months immediately preceding the events giving rise to such liability or (B) Five Hundred Dollars (USD $500). These limitations and exclusions regarding damages apply even if any remedy fails to provide adequate compensation.</>

<EULA.Header>Notwithstanding the foregoing, some countries, states, provinces or other jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of liability as stated above, so the above terms may not apply to you. Instead, in such jurisdictions, the foregoing exclusions and limitations shall apply only to the extent permitted by the laws of such jurisdictions. Also, you may have additional legal rights in your jurisdiction, and nothing in this Agreement will prejudice the statutory rights that you may have as a consumer of the Software.</>
