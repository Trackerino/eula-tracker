By applying to this Developer Program, you represent that you are legally an adult in your region.</p><p><strong>3.2	Enterprises. </strong>If you are accepting these Terms on behalf of a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or other legal entity, (“<strong>Enterprise</strong>”), you represent that you have authority to act on behalf of that Enterprise, and that such Enterprise accepts these Terms.

Epic uses a third-party payment provider to make Engagement Payout Award payments to Developer Program participants in <a href="https://docs.hyperwallet.com/content/transfer-methods/v1/paypal">these countries and regions</a>.</p><p><strong>3.8 </strong><strong>Teams. </strong>If Developers coordinate as a group or team to register for a single account to create Content (a “<strong>Team</strong>”), the individual owner of the account will be considered the leader of the Team (the “<strong>Team Leader</strong>”). By participating in a Team, you are giving the Team Leader<strong> </strong>the sole and exclusive right to act on behalf of the entire Team, yourself included. Teams may enter separate agreements regarding activities related to payments, Content, or the Team Leader’s authority, but Epic is not a party to and will not be bound by any agreement among or between the members of a Team .</p><p>If you decide to participate in a Team, you acknowledge the following:</p><ul><li>Any reference to “you” or “Developer” means the Team Leader.</li><li>Epic will make any payments under these Terms solely to the Team Leader. Members of a Team agree that their sole remedy in the event of a payment dispute is to seek recovery of any payment from the Team Leader, and waive any claims against Epic for payments made to the Team Leader.</li><li>If the Team elects a new Team Leader, the Team must contact Epic Player Support to notify Epic of the change and follow Epic’s procedures for verification. In the alternative, the Team may publish new content under the new Team Leader’s Epic Games account.</li></ul><p>Epic does not offer any opinion or advice concerning how a Team chooses to distribute Payouts among its members. However, it is incumbent upon the Team Leader to comply with all applicable laws and regulations concerning payment or nonpayment for services performed among a Team, including all applicable labor and employment laws <em>in each region where individual members of the Team reside</em>.</p><p><strong>4. Your Content and Conduct. </strong></p><p><strong>4.1	Restricted Content. </strong>Not all Content is eligible for monetization via the Developer Program. Content is only eligible for Payouts if it meets these conditions: it complies with these Terms (including all Epic Terms and Policies), is published to Fortnite by an Account owned and operated by you, and for which Epic makes monetization available.</p><p>By way of example, but without limiting any other Content restrictions specified in these Terms and you are not allowed to do any of the following:</p><ul><li><strong>Fake Engagement. </strong>You may not do anything that causes or encourages any artificial manipulation of genuine End User engagement, including by using automatic systems or providing third parties with incentives to increase artificial traffic, or otherwise manipulate metrics in any manner.</li><li><strong>Impersonation. </strong>You can't falsely use the identity of or claim to be another person, Developer, or brand, or otherwise cause confusion about the source of the Content or the source of goods or services included within the Content.</li><li><strong>Deception, Fraud, Spam. </strong>You may not spam, scam, or use other deceptive practices to trick End Users into misleading or taking advantage of other End Users. You may not misrepresent the features, price, functionality, nor limitations of any Content, including off-platform.</li><li><strong>Self-Dealing. </strong>You may not engage in self-dealing individually or in coordination with others by purchasing V-Bucks and using them to purchase your own content on a scale beyond what is necessary for ordinary testing of your Content.</li><li><strong>Reporting Abuse. </strong>You may not misuse any reporting, complaint, dispute, or appeals process, including by making groundless, vexatious, or frivolous submissions.</li><li><strong>Infringing Content. </strong>You may not: (a) publish Content infringing on copyright or trademarks, including Content such as third-party intellectual property (such as copyrighted material) or the Content of other Developers; or (b) incorporate or feature third-party intellectual property, including third-party intellectual property that appears in Fortnite (e.g. the Content of other Developers), in marketing or promotional materials related to your Content unless you have permission from that party or are otherwise legally entitled to do so. You and you alone are legally responsible for the Content you submit.</li><li><strong>Epic IP.  </strong>You do not have permission to use Epic-owned intellectual property (including trademarks and copyrighted Content) other than Epic-created Content provided to you expressly for use in your Content. You may use Epic-created Content (e.g., Epic-created environmental or character assets) in gameplay videos and in other marketing or promotional materials subject to the relevant Epic Policies, such as the Fortnite Developer Rules and Epic Brand Guidelines.</li><li>We respond to notices of alleged copyright infringement according to the process described <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/intellectual-property-ip-and-dmca-guidelines-for-fortnite-island-creators">here</a>. In appropriate circumstances, Epic’s policies provide for the termination of repeat infringers’ Account access.</li></ul><p><strong>4.2	Removal of Content </strong></p><p><strong>4.2.1	Removal of Content by Epic. </strong>If your Content violates these Terms or applicable law, Epic may remove, suspend availability to, or refuse to publish, any or all of your Content. Epic may also remove your Content in the event of any change in applicable laws, regulations, or policies that would otherwise risk liability for Epic, including compromising the integrity or operation of Fortnite.</p><p><strong>4.2.2	Removal of Content by You. </strong>You may remove your Content at any time.<strong> </strong>You must remove your Content from the Service if you no longer have the rights required by these Terms.</p><p><strong>4.2.3	Effect of Removal. </strong>Content that is removed is ineligible for Payouts upon removal.</p><p>Please note: Even if you delete or remove any previously published Content that violates these Terms, you can still be in violation of these Terms. Publishing prohibited Content at any time, even if it is later deleted or removed, can be the basis of a negative determination on your Epic Games Account.</p><p><strong>4.3	Terms Violations. </strong></p><p><strong>4.3.1	Payment Withholding. </strong>Epic may withhold or adjust the Payout associated with your violation of these Terms, including in the event that you violate Sections 4.1 or 4.4. If after issuing a Payout we determine that you violated these Terms before you earned such Payout, Epic reserves the right to recover that Payout by deducting such amounts from any future Payout you may receive. In certain circumstances, Epic may also temporarily suspend for a period of time the Payouts on any or all of your Content.</p><p><strong>4.3.2	Suspend or Terminate Developer Program Participation. </strong>Violation of these Terms, as determined by Epic in Epic’s sole discretion, may result in your temporary suspension from or permanent removal from the Developer Program. If your participation in the Developer Program has been suspended or terminated, you may not use another Account to circumvent these restrictions.</p><p><strong>4.3.3	Suspend or Terminate Account. </strong>Epic may terminate your Account in accordance with these Terms, the Epic’s policies, or any other agreement you have with Epic.</p><p><strong>4.4	Your Content Generally. </strong>You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any and all claims and liabilities involving or relating to your Content, including Developer-Made Content and Redeemable Developer-Made Content, both as defined in the Epic Games Terms of Service. You further acknowledge and agree to abide by all applicable local laws relating to the development of Your Content.</p><p><strong>4.5.	Notice. </strong>Epic will use reasonable commercial efforts to notify you in connection with any negative action taken in accordance with this Section and how to appeal the action unless we reasonably believe that to do so: (a) would violate the law, the direction of a legal enforcement authority, or otherwise risk legal liability for Epic or our Affiliates; (b) would compromise an ongoing investigation or the integrity or operation of Fortnite; or (c) would otherwise risk liability or harm to any End User, third party, Epic or our Affiliates.</p><p><strong>5. Payout Calculations.</strong></p><p><strong>5.1	Engagement Payout Award. </strong>Epic evaluates the performance of your Content in Fortnite by measuring how engaging End Users find that Content as a basis for an Engagement Payout Award which distributes a portion of spending from purchases of cosmetic and similar consumer items that are usable across all of Fortnite (the "<strong>Engagement Payout Pool</strong>") to developers based on engagement. Your Engagement Payout Award reflects the engagement attributable to your Content as a portion of End User engagement across all content in Fortnite, as solely determined by Epic. Epic will, from time to time, update the formula used to calculate Engagement Payout Awards. You can learn more about how the Engagement Payout Pool and your Engagement Payout Award are calculated <a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/fortnite/engagement-payout-in-fortnite-creative">here</a> by following developer news <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news">here</a>.</p><p><strong>5.2	Direct Economy Payout. </strong>On a monthly basis, Epic will apply a V-Buck effective value (“VEV”) to End User Credit (as defined by Section 10 of the Epic Terms of Service) redemptions for Redeemable Developer-Made Content (as defined by Section 11.3(a) of these Terms) in your experience. Epic will assign a VEV in US Dollars for each month by pooling, at a territorial or per-user granularity determined by Epic, all customer real-money spending to purchase V-Bucks during the month (converted to US Dollars), subtracting platform and store fees, and dividing the result by the total V-Bucks spent by players during that month. Your Direct Economy Payout is intended to approximately reflect the value of End User engagement with Redeemable Developer-Made Content. You can learn more about how the Direct Economy Payout is calculated <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-developers-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items">here</a> and by following developer news <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tag/fortnite-uefn-and-creative">here</a>.</p><p><strong>5.3	No Right to Audit. </strong>Neither these Terms nor any other agreement or legal principle provide any right for you or any third party to inspect or examine any of Epic’s data, documents, records, software, or systems, related to or in any way connected with the Developer Program. Epic has no duty to disclose any financial statements, balance sheets, formulas, or any other business records to you or any third party, specifically including any financial information related to the Payouts.</p><p><strong>6. Payment Details.</strong></p><p>Epic will distribute Payouts monthly. Here’s what to expect with Epic’s payout process:</p><p><strong>6.1	Payouts. </strong>You must successfully set up a payout account and complete any payout enrollment process required by the third-party service provider Epic engages to process and distribute Engagement Payout Awards and Direct Economy Payout (“<strong>Payout Provider</strong>”) before you can receive Payouts. You will have 60 days from Acceptance into the Developer Program to complete the enrollment process. If by that time you haven’t completed the enrollment process, you will not be able to receive any Payout Awards, any attributed purchases or redemptions will reset to zero, and we will terminate these Terms.</p><p><strong>6.2	Representatives. </strong>If you are acting as a Developer’s agent or representative, you certify that you are authorized to provide the specific payout information which you give to us and, where applicable, to receive Payouts from us. Epic is not responsible for, and will not adjudicate, any disputes between you and any other agent or entity relating to (a) payout information that you provide to us or (b) the payout or any apportionment of the payout between you and any third party.</p><p><strong>6.3 </strong><strong>Paid Monthly via Payout Provider. </strong>If you reach the Payout Minimum, we will distribute your Payouts approximately 30 days after the end of the month for which it is calculated. Your Payouts lag behind one month because we review engagement for the entire month. As an example, your November Payout would reflect your October engagement. You can view your Payout information within the Creator Portal.</p><p><strong>6.4	Payout Minimum. </strong>Generally, we only issue payment in amounts over $100 USD. If the Engagement Payout Award and Direct Economy Payout associated with your Account in aggregate do not equal or exceed $100 USD (the “<strong>Payout Minimum</strong>”), we will roll that amount over monthly and pay you when you cross the Payout Minimum threshold. The Payout Minimum threshold is considered every 12 months starting from the date of Acceptance into the Developer Program. If you do not reach the Payout Minimum threshold within a 12-consecutive month period, your Payouts will be reset to zero and you will have to start again. If you participate in other Epic monetization programs, Epic may, at its discretion, combine eligible rewards payable to you in connection with any other program to meet the Payout Minimum.</p><p><strong>6.5 </strong><strong>End User Engagement with Redeemable Developer-Made Content. </strong>When an End User engages with Redeemable Developer-Made Content with Credits in your Experience, a contractual relationship is formed between you and the End User.</p><p><strong>6.5.1 </strong><strong>[UK/EU] </strong>Notwithstanding Section 6.5., if a End User is located in the United Kingdom, European Union, or European Economic Area, and engages with Redeemable Developer-Made Content with Credits in your Experience, the contractual relationship is between you and Epic, on the one hand, and Epic and the End User, on the other hand.</p><p><strong>6.5.2	[Japan] </strong>Notwithstanding Sections 6.5. &amp; 6.5.1, if an End User is located in Japan, the contractual relationship with respect to the End User’s engagement with Redeemable Developer-Made Content with Credits is between the End User and Epic only. In relation to the End User, only Epic holds the status of the seller of the Content.</p><p><strong>6.6 </strong><strong>Payout Clawbacks </strong>. In the event Epic determines that any Payout was improperly provided to you, Epic may recoup or require repayment of all or portions of such Payout. To the fullest extent of the law, Epic may offset the amount to be recouped against any future Payouts or pursue repayment through other lawful means.</p><p><strong>7. Taxes.</strong></p><p><strong>7.1	Forms. </strong>We will need you to give us a completed Form W-9 (if you are based in the United States) or Form W-8BEN (if you are not based in the United States), bank account details, and other information for your tax onboarding so that we can pay you.</p><p><strong>7.2	Reporting and Withholding. </strong>You are responsible for the payment of all other taxes, including income taxes, self-employment taxes, levies, sales tax, VAT, and similar fees, due on payments we make to you under these Terms. In certain jurisdictions, tax regulations may require that we collect and/or report tax information about you, withhold taxes from payouts to you, or both. If you fail to provide us with documentation that we determine is sufficient to fulfill our obligation to withhold taxes from payouts to you, we may withhold payouts up to the amount as required by law, until you provide us with sufficient documentation.</p><p>If we have to withhold taxes on payments we make to you, we will deduct those taxes from the amount owed to you and pay the proper tax authorities. We will give you a receipt for any of these withholding taxes and we’ll also provide you other documents you reasonably request so that you can claim foreign tax credits or refunds.</p><p><strong>8. Fees. </strong></p><p><strong>8.1	 Payout Transaction Fees. </strong>Please note, transaction fees are charged by our Payout Provider on each Payout (which will be paid from any amounts that would otherwise be owed to you). Epic does not assess any additional fees.</p><p><strong>8.2	Third-Party Costs. </strong>You are <em>solely </em>responsible for any third party costs or fees associated with Epic’s publication of your Content. Epic’s only obligations under these Terms are to you, the individual End User Accepting these terms, and only upon Epic’s acceptance of your Application. Epic is not and will not be responsible for any commissions, taxes, fees, or other monies that you owe to others, including others who may have helped you create your Content.</p><p><strong>8.3	Third-Party Agreements. </strong>You acknowledge that Epic is not responsible under any guild, union, artist, record label, publishing company, third party licensor, or performing rights society agreement (“<strong>Third Party Agreements</strong>”) to use your Content as permitted under these Terms and Epic’s policies. If you create any content that is subject to such payments or obligations, you are solely responsible for making those payments. If any demand is made to Epic with regard to such payments, Epic reserves the right to: a) deduct such amounts from any payments owed to you; b) remove your Content; c) terminate or suspend these Terms until you have properly remitted payments to the appropriate parties; d) pursue any other remedies available to Epic at law or equity; or e) any combination of the foregoing.</p><p><strong>9. Developer Program Termination and Modification.</strong></p><p><strong>9.1	Epic’s Right to Modify. </strong>Epic may change these Terms, for example,<strong> </strong>modify, amend, add, remove, or modify the Eligibility Requirements, and change how we calculate Payouts, all at any time and for any reason by updating these Terms.</p><p>If we materially change these Terms, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice and the opportunity to review the changes, except in urgent situations, such as legal, regulatory, or security reasons or to prevent harm or liability to any End User, third party, Epic or our Affiliates. If you don’t agree to the new terms, you should stop using the Creator Portal and remove any Content you published.</p><p><strong>9.2	Epic’s Right to Terminate. </strong>The existence of this Developer Program today in no way creates an obligation for Epic to continue the program in the future, nor does it guarantee that you will receive any future Payouts. Epic may terminate these Terms at any time by providing you with at least 15 days’ notice.</p><p><strong>9.3	Your right to Terminate. </strong>You may terminate these terms any time by providing Epic at least 15 days’ notice.</p><p><strong>9.4	Effect of Suspension or Termination. </strong>Once you or we terminate these Terms, you will only be entitled to Payouts relating to the period prior to termination, and only if those that meet the Payout Minimum threshold.</p><p><strong>10. </strong><strong>Other Matters.</strong></p><p><strong>10.1	Disclosures. </strong>Both Users and their Content must comply with all legal and regulatory disclosure requirements, including endorsement disclosures, where applicable.</p><p><strong>10.2	No Employment Relationship with Epic. </strong>These Terms constitute a non-exclusive contract between Epic as a self-publishing platform for your Content and you as an independent Developer. Payouts are not wages. Voluntarily submitting Content for inclusion in Fortnite does not create an employment or independent contractor relationship between you and Epic. Epic is not hiring or engaging you to provide any service. As a participant in the Developer Program, you set your own schedule, and create Content only if, as and when you choose and without supervision, control, or direction by Epic. You are responsible for your own equipment and supplies that you use to create. You undertake these activities at your own risk, and you will not be entitled to worker’s compensation, insurance protection, or other benefits that Epic might provide to its employees.</p><p><strong>10.3	Assignment. </strong>You may not assign or transfer your rights and obligations under these Terms to any other person for any reason, and unless otherwise prohibited, any attempt by you to do so will be considered void and may also result in the termination of these Terms and your Account.</p><p><strong>10.4	LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. </strong>The limitations of liability set forth in Section 15 of the Epic Games Terms of Service are hereby incorporated by reference into these Terms with the same force and effect as if fully set forth herein.The provisions of this paragraph shall apply to the fullest extent authorized by applicable law: EPIC SHALL HAVE NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABILITY FOR CONTENT YOU CREATE, INCLUDING FOR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT CONTENT. DEVELOPER-MADE CONTENT IS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE DEVELOPER THAT MADE IT AVAILABLE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANY OTHER PROVISION HEREOF, IN NO EVENT SHALL EPIC OR ITS DIRECT OR INDIRECT SUBSIDIARIES, CONTROLLED AFFILIATES, AGENTS, EMPLOYEES, OR REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON OR ENTITY, REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF ACTION, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THESE TERMS, EVEN IF EPIC HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES OR LIABILITY.</p><p><strong>10.5	Indemnification. </strong>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Epic, its Affiliates, and each of the foregoing’s respective directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and assigns (collectively the “<strong>Epic Parties</strong>”), from and against any and all third party claims, loss, liability, injury, property damage, costs or damages arising from actual or threatened claims or causes of action for (a) your alleged or actual breach of these Terms, (b) your gross negligence or willful misconduct, or (c) arising from to your Content, including without limitation, Redeemable Developer-Made Content. In addition, End User agrees to defend, indemnify and hold the Epic Parties harmless from and against any and all third-party claims, damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable outside attorneys’ fees) arising from the Content, including, without limitation, related intellectual property claims. This provision shall survive the expiration or termination of these Terms.</p><p><strong>10.6	Insurance. </strong>You acknowledge that Epic does not provide for or carry any insurance of any kind for your benefit or that of your heirs, executors and administrators relative to your obligations under these Terms. You are solely responsible for obtaining and paying for any life, accident, automobile, employment-related, property or other insurance relative to your creation of Content, or any obligations you owe under these Terms.</p><p><strong>10.7	Choice of Law/Venue. </strong>These Terms and any disputes arising under them shall be governed by the laws of North Carolina applicable to contracts executed and performed entirely therein. Any action to enforce these Terms to which an applicable agreement to arbitrate does not apply shall be brought exclusively in the state courts in Wake County, North Carolina or, if federal jurisdiction exists, the United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina, and Epic and you irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of such courts and agree to waive any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum.</p><p><strong>10.8	Severability. </strong>If any provision of these Terms is or becomes or is deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable under the applicable laws or regulations of any jurisdiction, either such provision shall be deemed amended to conform to such laws or regulations without materially altering the intentions of the parties and enforced accordingly, or it shall be stricken and the remainder of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.</p><p><strong>10.9	Remedies. </strong>If Epic breaches any provision of these Terms, the damage, if any, caused to you thereby will not be irreparable or otherwise sufficient to entitle you to injunctive or other equitable relief with respect to any of Epic’s products and services. Your rights and remedies in any such event shall be strictly limited to the right, if any, to recover money damages in an action at law and to terminate these Terms in accordance with Section 9 of these Terms. You shall not be entitled by reason of any such breach to seek any injunctive or other equitable relief with respect to any of Epic’s products and services.
